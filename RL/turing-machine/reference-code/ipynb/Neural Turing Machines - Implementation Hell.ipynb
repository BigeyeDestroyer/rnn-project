The paper is relatively sparse when it comes to details of the architecture, and a lot more brief when it comes to the training process. Alex Graves trains RNNs a lot in his work, and it seems to me some of the tricks he has used here might have been distributed through his previous work."

      "\n",
      "It then goes on to describe the reading and writing mechanism, sometimes referring to \"multiple heads\". This got me confused as to whether there were separate read, erase, and write heads and corresponding weights to go along with each of these. Another possible way to implement this was to have, for each head, an erase, and an add head, with one set of weight parameters (parameters from which we calculate the current weight for this timestep from the previous). This is the version I finally settled with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other problem was to decide where the head[s] would go. Looking at previous LSTM papers, the write/forget gates are directly dependent on the input data as well, so this led me to think maybe the heads was a single layer network that directly gave a read, writes and erase on seeing input. I eventually settled for the heads being connected after the hidden layer.\n",
