### Introduction
This folder is for attention related works. 

### Works
1. [Attend, infer and Repeat][1]
	- ICML2016, Google
	- A framework for efficient inference in **structured image models** that explicitly **reason about objects**. **Probabilistic inference** with **rnn**. 

2. [RNN with attention for OCR in wild][2]
	- CVPR 2016
	- RNN with **attention model**, no need for lexicon.   

3. [Attentive Pooling][3] 
	- A two-way attention mechanism for discriminative model training. 
	- related work: [attention based CNN][4]

4. [Look, listen and learn][5]
	- AAAI 2016, from ShangTang technology. 
	- **Multi-modal speech recognition** by LSTM. 
	- [basic code][6], [updated code][7]
	- [data][8]

5. [Generate Headlines with RNN][9]

6. [Selective Search for word-spotting][10]
	- object proposals techniques emerge as an alternative to the traditional text detectors.
	- [code][11]

7. [Listen, attend and spell][12]
	- arxiv 2015
	- Composed of a listener and a speller
	- Listener: a pyramidal recurrent network encoder accepts filder bank spectra as inputs
	- Speller: an attention based recurrent netowrk decoder that emits characters as outputs. 


 8. [Listen, attend and walk][13]
	- arxiv 2015, 4 cited
	- translates natural language instructions to action sequences

9. [Playing atari][14]
	- NIPS2013, by Google Deepmind, 186 cited
	- deep learning + reinforcement learning 

10. [multiple object recognition][15]
	- Attention based RNN trained with reinforcement learning to attend the most relevant regions of the input image.
	- ICLR 2015, 51 cited

11. [DRAW][16]
	- A recurrent network for image generation 
	- ICML2015, 100 cited, from Google Deepmind

12. [Spatial transform network][17]
	- NIPS2015, 49 cited

13. [Social LSTM][18]
	- From Li Fei Fei
	- We should pay attention to the work of [Alexandre Alahi][19]

14. [Show attend and tell][20]
	- Bengio, ICML2015, 189 cited

15. [recurrent models of visual attention][21]
	- Alex Graves, NIPS2014, 96 cited

16. [gradient-following algorithms for RL][22]
	- 1992, 1112 cited
