### Intruduction
This folder contains the newly proposed works about rnn-related models such as new architectures, training algorithms, etc. 

### Works
1. [Neural Programmer][1]
	- Neural Programmer-Interpreter (NPI): A recurrent and compositional neural network that learns to represent and execute programs. 
	- Best paper for ICLR 2016 from Google DeepMind.

2. [FlappyBird][2]
	- This is a **RL + deep** example to solve practical problems. 
	- [RL in deep learning][3]

3. [Benefits of Depth in NN][4]
	- Analyzes VC-dimension for neural networks. 

4. [Neural Random Forests][5]
